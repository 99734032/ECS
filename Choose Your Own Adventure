He sends you a very mysterious letter telling you that he has exactly what you’ve been searching for. For years you’ve been looking for a small, black diamond; a supposed lost heirloom of an ancient Egyptian family. The letter gives you instructions to go to the outskirts of the city to a tavern called Wild. He says to come alone and unarmed. You have three options. Type “1” if you would like to go to the tavern alone with a small, well concealed dagger to keep yourself protected. Type “2” if you want to go to the tavern with a trusted friend named Oliver. You will both be unarmed in this choice. Type “3” if you want to ignore this letter and continue to search for the relic yourself.");

You enter the tavern, dagger concealed in a seam of your coat. As you enter you see a hooded figure with a mug in front of them sitting at a table. You check out your surroundings. The tavern is dimly lit and the hooded man is the only person you can see. He quickly stands up brandishing a massive sword, ready to fight at any moment. There are three things you can do. Type “1” if you will pull out your own dagger and would like to engage in combat. You have been trained to fight and know that you stand a chance. Type “2” if you want to de-escalate the situation and attempt to get the information you came for. Type “3” if you want to quickly run away to safety.” ");

You jump into action attacking with your dagger swinging back and forth. He expertly evades and attempts to counter with his much longer sword. You duck away and are able to use your leg to kick him in the shin. He stumbles slightly and pulls out a small, black ball. He expertly twists the top and rolls it towards you. You don’t know what exactly it is but know that it can’t be good. You jump back as it starts hissing and then explodes into black smoke. You can’t see anything and are coughing violently.

Perhaps we can work something out.” You reply, “What do you want from me?” He grins again, “I want my son. Oliver.” You stare back in shock. Oliver had never spoken about his family. He has been a good friend and you’re not going to betray him. “No.” you speak out defiantly. “I’ll find another way.” The man frowns and then quickly whips out a small, black ball.

Type “1” if you want to stay around and talk to Oliver’s supposed father. Type “2” if you want to try and take on the  man and fight. He looks to be unarmed but you can’t be sure.
